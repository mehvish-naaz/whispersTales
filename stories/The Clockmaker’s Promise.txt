In a quiet village, there lived an old clockmaker named Elric. His little shop stood at the corner of the square, filled with clocks that sang at every hour — cuckoos, chimes, and soft melodies that made the street feel alive.

For fifty years, Elric had repaired clocks for everyone in town, from the mayor’s gold pocket watch to the baker’s soot-covered alarm clock. Yet one clock remained unfinished — a small wooden one he had promised to build for his late wife, Clara.

Every evening, he would wind the clocks, dust the shelves, and sit by that unfinished one, tracing its carvings with trembling hands. “Tomorrow,” he’d whisper, “I’ll finish it tomorrow.”

One winter night, as snow drifted through the street, a young girl named Anna stepped inside, holding a broken timepiece. Her father had passed away, and it was his last gift to her. Elric smiled softly. “Some clocks hold more than time,” he said.

He worked all night, repairing her watch — and something in him healed, too. When the dawn came, he finished Clara’s clock at last, engraving the words “Time may pass, but love remains.”

When the clock chimed for the first time, the whole shop seemed to breathe. The sound echoed through the street — a song of promises kept."
