Mira lived in a small attic overlooking the harbor. Every morning, she watched ships disappear into the horizon, wondering where they went and if dreams could sail that far.

She spent her days folding tiny paper birds from scraps of old letters and newspaper — hundreds of them, each with a wish written on its wings. “Fly where I cannot,” she’d whisper, setting them on the window sill.

One evening, as rain swept across the town, a gust of wind carried her newest bird out to sea. Mira sighed, closing the window against the storm. But when morning came, she found something strange — a seashell on her windowsill, glimmering faintly, and beside it, 
a note:
"Your wish reached the wind."

Every day after that, new shells appeared — smooth stones, sea glass, tiny treasures — each with words like "I heard your dreams" or "The sea remembers."

Years passed, and Mira grew old, but she never stopped folding birds. One morning, when the tide was high and the sky was gold, she vanished from the attic — only a trail of paper birds remained, fluttering toward the horizon.

Some say if you walk by the harbor at dawn, you can still see them — little white wings dancing over the waves.
